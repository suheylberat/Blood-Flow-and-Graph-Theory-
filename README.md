# Blood-Flow-and-Graph-Theory

In an article I read, they were trying to give a different perspective on congenital heart diseases with graph theory. I tried to make sense of a few heart diseases that I found different with graph theory.
This article explains blood flow between vessels in the heart with graph theory, so I want to see some heart diseease with grapg theory. 

First heart disease is Atrial Septal Defect. An atrial septal defect is a birth defect of the heart in which there is a hole in the wall (septum) that divides the upper chambers (atria) of the heart. A hole can vary in size and may close on its own or may require surgery. An atrial septal defect is one type of congenital heart defect. Congenital means present at birth. 

Second heart disease is Mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse(MVP) occurs when the mitral valve leaflet tissue is deformed and elongated so that the leaflets do not come together normally. This abnormal valve motion may allow blood to leak backwards from the left ventricle into the left atrium. This leak forcing the heart to pump more strongly.

You can see a normal heart graph, with Atrial Septal Sefect and with Mitral Valve Prolapse in codes. Also, there are binary adjacency matrix in codes. There is a problem in MVP's binary adjacency matrix. If you can help me, I will be so happy.
